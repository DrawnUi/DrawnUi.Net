👉 [Official Site](https://drawnui.net)   

DrawnUI is a rendering and UI composition engine for .NET, powered by [SkiaSharp](https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp) with gestures, layouts, effects and animations running with hardware acceleration.

🤩 [Fiddle in browser](https://fiddle.drawnui.net) 👈

Supported hosts:

* `DrawnUi.Maui` - Android, iOS, MacCatalyst, and Windows.
* `DrawnUi.Blazor.Wasm` - browser WebAssembly rendering.
* `DrawnUi.Blazor.Server` - server-backed DrawnUI surfaces served by Blazor Server.
* `DrawnUi.Wasm` - pure browser WebAssembly, no Blazor required.
* `DrawnUi.OpenTk` - Windows and Linux desktops.
* `DrawnUi.Net` - platform-agnostic console/server rendering scenarios.

## React?

DrawnUI for React just appeared as a standalone DrawnUI engine in TypeScript, running on [CanvasKit](https://skia.org/docs/user/modules/canvaskit/) (Skia compiled to WebAssembly) in the browser. It tends to use same API as the .NET version. 
Under active development, more info [on our site](https://drawnui.net/articles/react).

## What's New 1.10.6.14
  
  * Fix `SkiaShell` unfrozen modal push no longer holds the navigation lock forever
  * Fix images loading: sync local loads decode inline; cancelled loads release parked requests
  * Fix `SkiaScroll` LoadMore distances (`LoadMoreOffset`, `LoadMoreTopOffset`) are points and were multiplied by the rendering scale, so on a 3x screen the bottom trigger fired at any position once re-armed, e.g. at a top overscroll right after an append. The viewport init also no longer snaps the offset to 0 while a pan, fling, bounce or refresh runs (one-frame jag when an append re-measured a Split grid mid-bounce).
  
 ### Previously

   * Fix `SkiaDrawer` was not removing its previous content when `Content` was replaced or set to null: the old child stayed in `Views` and was disposed together with the drawer, so a kept modal content came back disposed on its next presentation (blur, no popup).
  * Center alignment: an overflowing box is moved back inside its parent instead of being truncated.
  * Fix `SkiaCarousel` to block gestures for nor current slides
  * Fix wheel picker to work properly when hosted inside a scroll container
  * Fix `SkiaEditor` was leeking native entry display on latest iOS version.
  * Fix `SkiaScroll` margins were applied to limit scrolling bounds
  * Fix autosized `SkiaScroll` not expanding horizontally after content changed
  * Fix centering text inside `SkiaEditor`
  * Fix `SkiaScroll` margins were applied to limit scrolling bounds
  * Fix autosized `SkiaScroll` not expanding horizontally after content changed
  * Updated docs and skills at [https://drawnui.net](https://drawnui.net)
